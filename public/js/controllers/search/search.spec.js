It is not your run-of-the-mill seat cover. In fact, it can hardly be placed in the same category. The Seat Defender is unique in its design and function because it is intended to be used as needed. Rather than being a permanent cover up for damaged or unsightly interior, the ARIES Seat Defender works to stop the damage before it happens. Unlike your everyday seat cover, the Seat Defender excels in being easy to put on and simple to take off. This makes it a ready defense against potential threats, from muddy boots and pet dander to dirty tools and equipment. It is also great to have on hand for those days at the beach and after sporting events. Whenever you need it, simply unfold the Seat Defender, place it over the seat, and you have a perfect line of defense against sand, water, mud, debris, food and even odor.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe ARIES Seat Defender is also easy to store and keep clean. Because it is not a permanent seat cover, we designed it to be fast to clean up, faster to put away and even faster to install the next time you need it. The Seat Defender is made of a high-quality, two-sided material to withstand even the most extreme conditions. The bottom side is a TPR (thermal plastic rubber) that grips the seat and offers an anti-skid surface for the user. TPR also adds an element of water and wear resistance. The top side of the Seat Defender is made from a 600D Terelene fabric to resist spills and shed water for easier cleanup.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSimply put, the ARIES Seat Defender is the ideal solution for protecting your vehicleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interior.

It is not your run-of-the-mill seat cover. In fact, it can hardly be placed in the same category. The Seat Defender is unique in its design and function because it is intended to be used as needed. Rather than being a permanent cover up for damaged or unsightly interior, the ARIES Seat Defender works to stop the damage before it happens. Unlike your everyday seat cover, the Seat Defender excels in being easy to put on and simple to take off. This makes it a ready defense against potential threats, from muddy boots and pet dander to dirty tools and equipment. It is also great to have on hand for those days at the beach and after sporting events. Whenever you need it, simply unfold the Seat Defender, place it over the seat, and you have a perfect line of defense against sand, water, mud, debris, food and even odor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ARIES Seat Defender is also easy to store and keep clean. Because it is not a permanent seat cover, we designed it to be fast to clean up, faster to put away and even faster to install the next time you need it. The Seat Defender is made of a high-quality, two-sided material to withstand even the most extreme conditions. The bottom side is a TPR (thermal plastic rubber) that grips the seat and offers an anti-skid surface for the user. TPR also adds an element of water and wear resistance.

Our 304 stainless steel finish is a true stainless steel, resisting rust and sporting a highly polished finish that is made to last. Our semi-gloss black powder coat finish, on the other hand, is applied to our carbon steel oval side bars and offers excellent protection against scratching, chipping and peeling. Something that sets the ARIES 4â€ oval side bar apart from all others is its blended end caps. Rather than capping our side bars with a plastic cap and leaving them more susceptible to corrosion â€“ not to mention giving them a cheap look â€“ we offer a blended end cap for a smooth, more finished appearance. The blend end cap feature is applied to both our carbon and stainless steel 4â€ ovals. We also equip the ends with a special 45Â° bend and original equipment styling to perfectly contour to your vehicle. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eARIES 4â€ oval side bars are fitted with raised step pads to provide a wide stepping surface. The polyethylene construction of our step pads will not crack over time, and because it has a textured grip, the surface is highly resistant to slips and skids, even when wet. To add an extra element of class to our oval sides, we also fit each one with a stainless steel insignia bearing the ARIES name.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eInstallation of ARIES 4â€ oval side bars is quick and easy with custom-fitted mounting brackets, and no drilling is necessary.
