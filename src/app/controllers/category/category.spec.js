Rather than being a permanent cover up for damaged or unsightly interior, the ARIES Seat Defender works to stop the damage before it happens. Unlike your everyday seat cover, the Seat Defender excels in being easy to put on and simple to take off. This makes it a ready defense against potential threats, from muddy boots and pet dander to dirty tools and equipment. It is also great to have on hand for those days at the beach and after sporting events. Whenever you need it, simply unfold the Seat Defender, place it over the seat, and you have a perfect line of defense against sand, water, mud, debris, food and even odor.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe ARIES Seat Defender is also easy to store and keep clean. Because it is not a permanent seat cover, we designed it to be fast to clean up, faster to put away and even faster to install the next time you need it. The Seat Defender is made of a high-quality, two-sided material to withstand even the most extreme conditions. The bottom side is a TPR (thermal plastic rubber) that grips the seat and offers an anti-skid surface for the user. TPR also adds an element of water and wear resistance. The top side of the Seat Defender is made from a 600D Terelene fabric to resist spills and shed water for easier cleanup.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSimply put, the ARIES Seat Defender is the ideal solution for protecting your vehicleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interior.

It is not your run-of-the-mill seat cover. In fact, it can hardly be placed in the same category. The Seat Defender is unique in its design and function because it is intended to be used as needed. Rather than being a permanent cover up for damaged or unsightly interior, the ARIES Seat Defender works to stop the damage before it happens. Unlike your everyday seat cover, the Seat Defender excels in being easy to put on and simple to take off. This makes it a ready defense against potential threats, from muddy boots and pet dander to dirty tools and equipment. It is also great to have on hand for those days at the beach and after sporting events. Whenever you need it, simply unfold the Seat Defender, place it over the seat, and you have a perfect line of defense against sand, water, mud, debris, food and even odor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ARIES Seat Defender is also easy to store and keep clean. Because it is not a permanent seat cover, we designed it to be fast to clean up, faster to put away and even faster to install the next time you need it. The Seat Defender is made of a high-quality, two-sided material to withstand even the most extreme conditions. The bottom side is a TPR (thermal plastic rubber) that grips the seat and offers an anti-skid surface for the user. TPR also adds an element of water and wear resistance. The top side of the Seat Defender is made from a 600D Terelene fabric to resist spills and shed water for easier cleanup.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply put, the ARIES Seat Defender is the ideal solution for protecting your vehicleâ€™s interior. It is perfect for pet owners, outdoor enthusiasts, soccer moms, industrial and commercial workers, frequenters of the beach and boat landing and many others. The Seat Defender comes in two universal styles to fit both bucket seats and bench seats. Both are available in your choice of black, grey or brown."}]},{"id":308,"parent_id":0,"sort":4,"date_added":"2014-10-20T18:39:53-05:00","title":"Misc Items","short_description":"Misc Items","long_description":"Misc Items","color_code":"","font_code":"","image":null,"icon":null,"lifestyle":false,"vehicle_specific":false,"vehicle_required":false,"sub_categories":[{"id":309,"parent_id":308,"sort":1,"date_added":"2014-10-20T18:41:29-05:00","title":"Seat Defenders","short_description":"Seat Defenders","long_description":"Seat Defenders","color_code":"","font_code":"","image":null,"icon":null,"lifestyle":false,"vehicle_specific":false,"vehicle_required":false},{"id":310,"parent_id":308,"sort":1,"date_added":"2014-10-20T18:41:59-05:00","title":"Floor Liners","short_description":"Floor Liners","long_description":"Floor Liners","color_code":"","font_code":"","image":null,"icon":null,"lifestyle":false,"vehicle_specific":false,"vehicle_required":false},{"id":311,"parent_id":308,"sort":1,"date_added":"2014-10-20T18:42:33-05:00","title":"Universal Mud Flaps","short_description":"Universal Mud Flaps","long_description":"Universal Mud Flaps","color_code":"","font_code":"","image":null,"icon":null,"lifestyle":false,"vehicle_specific":false,"vehicle_required":false},{"id":312,"parent_id":308,"sort":1,"date_added":"2014-10-20T18:43:22-05:00","title":"Headache Racks","short_description":"Headache Racks","long_description":"Headache Racks","color_code":"","font_code":"","image":null,"icon":null,"lifestyle":false,"vehicle_specific":false,"vehicle_required":false}]}],"videos":null,"packages":[{"height":14,"width":10,"length":3,"weight":1,"dimensionUnit":"IN","dimensionUnitLabel":"Inch","weightUnit":"LB","weightUnitLabel":"Pound","packageUnit":"EA","packageUnitLabel":"Each","quantity":1,"packageType":{}}],"customer":{"price":0,"cart_reference":0},"class":{},"inventory":{"total_availability":0,"inventory":null}},{"id":2090054,"status":800,"price_code":0,"related_count":0,"average_review":0,"date_modified":"2014-10-27T15:41:47-05:00","date_added":"2014-10-19T00:00:00-05:00","short_description":"Pro Series Grill Guard","part_class":"","install_sheet":null,"attributes":[{"key":"UPC","value":"849055029341"}],"vehicle_atttributes":null,"content":[{"key":"HTMLDescription","value":"\u003cp\u003eThe ARIES Pro Series grille guard is loaded with unique features that will set your truck or SUV apart from all others.
